YuZJLab              AutoZip & AutoUnZip                 Manual

NAME
____autozip - An automatic file compression tool.
____autounzip - An automatic file decompression tool.
____libautozip - Library for above files.

DESCRIPTION
    1. autozip
        The first thing to do after installation. This will 
        check the algorithms installed on your computer and 
        give back a list of available extension name.
    2. autozip [source] 
        This will compress files and folders with default 
        extension gz & tar.gz.
    3. autozip [source] [ext] 
        This will compress files and folders with extension 
        [ext].
    4. autozip [source] [ext] [level]
        This will compress files and folders with extension 
        [ext] to [level]. You can make it 1 (fastest)-9 (best).
         Some algorithms (e.g. xzip, zip) may support 0
        (store only; no compression).
    5. autounzip
        Almost equal to autozip.
    6. autounzip [source]
        Extract [source]. If the archive is SPLITTED, suffix 
        like "001" or "z01" should not be added. HOWEVER, for
        rar you should indicate the FIRST part. For example, 
        "r1.part1.rar"

OPTIONS (NEED GETOPT)
    Several arguments is available to autozip and zutounzip.
    You should place them AFTER the [source] [ext] or  [level]
    field. They are:
    FOR BOTH
        -h|--help
            Show this help.
        -v|--version
            Print version.
        --force-parallel:[location]
            Force to use GUN parallel at [location]. This will
            not affect pgzip, XZ Utils or other algorithms 
            which do not require GNU Parallel.
    FOR AUTOZIP ONLY
        -s[:[split]]|-split[:[split]]
            Split the archive by [split]. This is realized by 
            using GNU coreunits "split" or those provided in 
            corresponding algorithms like 7zip, zip or rar. If
            [split] is omitted, it will be treated as 1G. legal
            [split] are those which can be recognized by GNU 
            coreunits "split" or corresponding algorithms.

            When making a tar.?z archive, this will split the 
            tar file and compress them orderly.

            When using zip format, we'll use "zip -FF" to merge
            the zips.

USE OF GNU PARALLEL (REQUIRE ROOT PREVILEDGE)
    It is recommended to use GNU Parallel to accelerate the 
    speed of compression. You can change the first line of
    autoxip.conf to "PARALLEL" to enable this feature. GNU
    Parallel is not available on autounzip.

    When using XZ Utils, we will use argument "-T0" instead of
    GNN Parallel.
    
    WARNING! GNU Parallel consumes lots of memory & CPU 
    resources. NEVER USE IT ON CLUSTERS!!!

USE OF PIGZ
    When pigz, GNU parallel both exist and you have PARALLEL in
    autozip.conf, pigz will be used.

USE OF GNU GZIP
    When processing bioinformatical data, please make sure that
    You should use GZIP to produce a GZIP COMPRESSED DATA 
    instead of BGZIP to produce a BLOCKED GNU ZIP FORMAT
    before using this tool!

USE OF BGZIP
    This is the right way to produce a BLOCKED GNU ZIP FORMAT
    with "gz" extension. Because it is capable of GNU GZip, 
    we'll not distinguish them when extracting data. "tar.gz"
    is not supported in bgz format because it sounds weird.

USE OF LZMA SDK AND XZ UTILS
    The core of the XZ Utils compression code is based on LZMA 
    SDK. So when you're about to compress & decompress files 
    with lz, lzma, tar.lzma, tlz extensions, we'll use XZ Utils.

USE OF 7ZIP
    WARNING: DO NOT USE the 7-zip format for backup purpose on 
    Linux/Unix because 7-zip does not store the owner/group of 
    the file.

    Although 7-zip provided us with a handful of algorithms, we
    will only take default values.

USE OF RAR
    WARNING: 1. RAR is a PROPERTY software. 2. Use ABSOLUTE PATH.


EXIT STATUS
    0. OK
    1. ERROR
