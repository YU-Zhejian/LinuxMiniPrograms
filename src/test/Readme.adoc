= ReadMe for `test`

This folder contains the testing scripts. These scripts can be executed in a stand-alone order, or to be accessed by using `make test` in the root directory of LinuxMiniPrograms. See `LMP_basis` for more details.

The tests are organized in a modular order. For each test, a directoru named `[PROGNAME]` is created and all tests are executed there.

To avoid interfering normal programs, for programs like `git-mirror` or `ylsjs`, its `var` directory is pointed to `[PROGNAME]`.

== Writing New tests

To write a new test, the template is provided as follows:

[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -eu
DN="$(readlink -f "$(dirname "${0}")")"
PROGNAME=[PROGNAME]
. "${DN}"/00_libtest.sh
[...]
rm -rf "${TDN}" # This variable is specified in "${DN}"/00_libtest.sh. It is where the tests are executed. It is removed if the test is successful.
----

You may specify the program(s) you need to test in `[PROGNAME]` and write what you need to test in `[...]`.
