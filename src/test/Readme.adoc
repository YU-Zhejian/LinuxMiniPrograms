= Readme for `test`

This folder contains the testing scripts. These scripts can be executed in a stand-alone order, or to be accessed by using `make test` in the root directory of LinuxMiniPrograms. See `LMP_basis` for more details.

The tests are organized in a modular order. For each test, a directory named `[PROGNAME]` is created and all tests are executed there.

To avoid interfering normal programs, for programs like `git-mirror` or `ylsjs`, its `var` directory is pointed to `[PROGNAME]`.

When `make test` is executed, the GNU Make system will execute `00_index.sh` under this folder. This script will search for all files ended in `t.sh` and execute them.

Due to the reason that all testing scripts uses YuZJLab LibDO, by default LibDO is tested with the highest priority in `01_libdo.t.sh`.

All test files sources `00_libtest.sh`. It sources YuZJLab LibDO and creates a test directory whose path is stored in `${TDN}`.

== Write a New Test

To write a new test, the template is provided as follows:

[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -eu
DN="$(readlink -f "$(dirname "${0}")")"
PROGNAME=[PROGNAME]
. "${DN}"/00_libtest.sh
[...]
# This variable is specified in "${DN}"/00_libtest.sh. It is where the tests are executed.
----

You may specify the program(s) you need to test in `[PROGNAME]` and write what you need to test in `[...]`.

== Automatic Report Generation

Report is generated in an Asciidoc format. You may compile it to other formats if you wish.

Please make sure that module `pandas` is installed in your _DEFAULT_ Python.
