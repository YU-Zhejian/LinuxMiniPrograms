== News: `etc/path.sh` renamed to `etc/path.conf`

To keep consistent, we have renamed `etc/path.sh` to `etc/path.conf`.

You may apply this patch by executing

[source,bash]
----
if [ ! -f 'etc/path.conf' ] && [ -f 'etc/path.sh' ];then mv 'etc/path.sh' 'etc/path.conf';fi
----

at the root directory of your LinuxMiniPrograms installation.
