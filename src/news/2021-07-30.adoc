= News: Documentation separated into section `1` and `7`

All documentations written in Asdiidoc is separated into sub-directory `1` and `7`, making it possible to integrate into man database. As is indicated by the documentation of man database, these numbers means:

. Executable programs or shell commands
. System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
. Library calls (functions within program libraries)
. Special files (usually found in /dev)
. File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
. Games
. Miscellaneous (including  macro  packages  and  conventions),  e.g. man(7), groff(7)
. System administration commands (usually only for root)
. Kernel routines [Non standard]

From now on, all executables will be moved to section 1 and all libraries, including those in Shell, Python or C, will be moved into section 7.
