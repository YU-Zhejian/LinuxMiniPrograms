# The Additional (Optional) Programs Carried by YuZJLab LinuxMiniPrograms

In this directory, you may find some interesting little programs which may help you through difficulties. They have little correlations with YuZJLab LinuxMiniPrograms, but as they're developed by me, I have them included.

They are:

* `envgen` Environment generator and detector.
* `code-spec` How to write readable codes (Python and Bash script) for green hands.
* `LMP_dev` Develop LinuxMiniPrograms with ease.

More interesting little programs are being purposed!
