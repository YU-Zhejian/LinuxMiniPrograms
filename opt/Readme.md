# The Additional (Optional) Programs Carried by YuZJLab LinuxMiniPrograms

In this directory, you may find some interesting little programs which may help you through difficulties. They have little correlations with YuZJLab LinuxMiniPrograms, but as they're developed by me, I have them included.

They are:

* `envgen` Environment generator and detector.
* `lmp_dev` Develop LinuxMiniPrograms with ease.

More interesting little programs are being purposed!

Files located under `exec/` are used for installation purposes. Do not execute them.
