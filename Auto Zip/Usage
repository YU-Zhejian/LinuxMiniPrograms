NAME
    autozip - An automatic file compression tool.
    autounzip - An automatic file decompression tool.
DESCRIPTION
    1. autozip
        The first thing to do after installation. This will 
        check the algorithms installed on your computer and 
        give back a list of available extension name.
    2. autozip [source] 
        This will compress files and folders with default 
        extension gz & tar.gz.
    3. autozip [source] [ext] 
        This will compress files and folders with extension 
        [ext].
    4. autozip [source] [ext] [level]
        This will compress files and folders with extension 
        [ext] to [level]. You can make it 1 (fastest) - 9 
        (best). Some algorithms (e.g. xzip, zip) may support 0 
        (store only; no compression).
    5. autounzip 
        Almost equal to autozip.
    6. autounzip [source]
        Extract [source].
USE OF GNU PARALLEL (REQUIRE ROOT PREVILEDGE)
    It is recommended to use GNU Parallel to accelerate the 
    speed of compression. You can change the first line of
    autoxip.conf to "PARALLEL" to enable this feature. GNU
    Parallel is not available on autounzip.

    When using XZ Utils, we will use argument "-T0" instead of
    GNN Parallel.
    
    WARNING! GNU Parallel consumes lots of memory & CPU 
    resources.
USE OF LZMA SDK AND XZ UTILS
    The core of the XZ Utils compression code is based on LZMA 
    SDK. So when you're about to compress & decompress files 
    with lz, lzma, tar.lzma, tlz extensions, we'll use XZIP.
USE OF 7ZIP
    WARNING: DO NOT USE the 7-zip format for backup purpose on 
    Linux/Unix because 7-zip does not store the owner/group of 
    the file.
USE OF RAR
    WARNING: 1. RAR is a PROPERTY software. 2. Use ABSOLUTE PATH.
