YuZJLab                    Auto Zip                      Manual 
NAME
    autozip - An automatic file compression tool
DESCRIPTION
    1. autozip
        The first thing to do after installation. This will 
        check the algorithms installed on your computer and 
        give back a list of available extension name.
    2. autozip [source] 
        This will compress files and folders with default 
        extension gz & tar.gz.
    3. autozip [source] [ext] 
        This will compress files and folders with extension 
        [ext].
    4. autozip [source] [ext] [level]
        This will compress files and folders with extension 
        [ext] to [level]. You can make it 1 (fastest) - 9 
        (best). Some algorithms (e.g. xzip, zip) may support 0 
        (store only; no compression).
USE OF GNU PARALLEL (WITH ROOT PREVILEDGE)
    It is recommended to use GNU Parallel to accelerate the 
    speed of compression. You can change the first line of
    autoxip.conf to "PARALLEL" to enable this feature.
    
    WARNING! GNU Parallel consumes lots of memory & CPU 
    resources.
